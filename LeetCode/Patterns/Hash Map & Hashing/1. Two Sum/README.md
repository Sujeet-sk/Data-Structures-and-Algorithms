### 📜 Problem Description

You are given an array of integers  `nums`  and an integer  `target` , return  *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to  `target`* .

You may assume that each input would have  ***exactly*  one solution** , and you may not use the  *same*  element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**   `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`

**Output:**   `[0,1]`

**Explanation:**

The sum of  `nums[0]`  and  `nums[1]`  is  `2 + 7 = 9` , which equals the target. Therefore, the indices  `[0, 1]`  are returned.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**   `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`

**Output:**   `[1,2]`

**Explanation:**

The sum of  `nums[1]`  and  `nums[2]`  is  `2 + 4 = 6` , which equals the target. Therefore, the indices  `[1, 2]`  are returned.

**Example 3:**

**Input:**   `nums = [3,3], target = 6`

**Output:**   `[0,1]`

**Explanation:**

The sum of  `nums[0]`  and  `nums[1]`  is  `3 + 3 = 6` , which equals the target. Therefore, the indices  `[0, 1]`  are returned.

**Constraints:**

	
- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
	
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
	
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
	
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

 **Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than  `O(n2)`  time complexity?
